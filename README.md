This project investigates adversarial examples in neural networks, comparing the effectiveness of the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) with an Iterative FGSM approach. 
It evaluates their performance in generating adversarial examples for a trained neural network on the MNIST dataset, highlighting strengths and areas for further improvement.
